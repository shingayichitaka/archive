# Archive

An archive for all the projects and small mini applications that I am working on.

## How it works:

### CLI Commands:

- `npm start`: Enter a project name after you have created it within your frontend directory, so that it can be add to the projects.json and be rendered dynamically.

- `npm test`: Runs vitest for the entire project and displays the output via the CLI.
